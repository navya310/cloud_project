3.	Project Description 

          The main idea of this project is to design an application that will run on most of the phones and will be helpful when visiting some new places and cities. 
  The application will find a path that fulfils few criteria such as finding the shortest path to visit famous places, show it on screen, show names of objects, some short descriptions and photos of them.
